This assignment is used to measure the effectiveness of Martingale Strategy in Roulette.

Martingale strategy is one where you double your bet if you lose, and reset your bet to $1 when you win.

The figures are generated by running martingale.py.

Figure 1 to 3 are simulations of martingale strategy with an unlimited bank roll.

Figure 4 to 5 are simulations of the same strategy with a limited bank roll of $256.

Pseudocode for Martingale Strategy:
- episode_winnings = $0
    - while episode_winnings < $80:
        - won = False
        - bet_amount = $1
        - while not won
            - wager bet_amount on black
            - won = result of roulette wheel spin
            - if won == True:
                - episode_winnings = episode_winnings + bet_amount
            - else:
                - episode_winnings = episode_winnings - bet_amount
                - bet_amount = bet_amount * 2
